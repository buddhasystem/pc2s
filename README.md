# pc2s: Portable Conditions and Calibrations Service

The aim of the project is to realize a fully portable, configurable,
experiment-agnostic service for the Conditons and Calibrations data.
Part of it was inspired by the Belle II CDB, however there are significant
differences.

Time-series handling capability is experimental.
