The Portable Conditions and Calibrations Service (PC2S) is based
on concepts developed by the HEP Software Foundation. It's objective
is to manage metadata for calibrations and conditions and locate
these data for delivery to processing jobs.

PC2S is based on the Django framework and comes equipped with a suite
of clients providing the functionality of managing the database and
accessing its content. These Web pages provide the monitoring capability
for the system.

The sidebar on the left contains links to the PC2S monitoring pages
and documentation.
